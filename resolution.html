    <!-- Challenge Instructions
Itâ€™s time for the ðŸ¥‚ New Yearâ€™s Resolutions Challenge! This month, put your coding skills to the test by creating a beautifully designed landing page that showcases your 2025 resolutions. Whether itâ€™s a commitment to learning something new, improving your health, or pursuing a passion project, bring your goals to life and share them with the community.

Use different elements like text, buttons, links, and images to make your page visually appealing. Tell us why these resolutions matter to youâ€”maybe theyâ€™re inspired by personal experiences, dreams youâ€™re eager to achieve, or changes youâ€™ve long wanted to make. Share what makes these goals important and how theyâ€™ll shape your year ahead. ðŸŒŸ -->
